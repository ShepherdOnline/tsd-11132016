Please keep in your prayers 2 of our former pageant contestants and 2 members of the Shepherd Equestrian team and their friends and family as they were involved in a severe automobile accident last night that involved 2 of the girls being airlifted to Hellen Devos in Grand Rapids. Stay strong girls and we will be praying for a speed recovery for all of you!
 
Love Sara and Lisa
