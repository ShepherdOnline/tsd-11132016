One of our own, Meghan Ruby Schutt was in a bad car accident... Brianna Swan known as BZ was also with her and at DeVos too. Mattea and AZ were also in the car...

Her mom wrote:

<blockquote>"OK... Meghan was in a car accident tonight with her friends and was sent to Helen DeVoss in Grand Rapids.
It's 5:45 am and we are finally getting settled in for some rest.
She has some skull fractures and her jaw is broken. She is being a trooper!
Please pray for her, she has a long road ahead of her. The specialist's will! be here in the morning and we will know more. Will keep updates coming."</blockquote>

Asking for strength and prayers...

Blue Jay strong!!
