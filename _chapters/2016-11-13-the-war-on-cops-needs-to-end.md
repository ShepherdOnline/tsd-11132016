SOAPBOX MOMENT....
Sorry to start off your Saturday with a rant, but this just needs to be said -- the war on cops by pure evil needs to stop! 2 officers and a Police K9 were all shot yesterday in Boise Idaho. 120 law enforcement officers have already died in 2016, with 17 of those happening in October and 9 already in November.
While we understand it is a possible hazard of the job, no officer I know accepted this calling to die. Our ultimate goal every day is to end our shift and go home to our families...which I don't think is too much to ask.
So on this 12th day of November, 2016 I ask everyone of you to hold your loved ones tight, don't sweat the small stuff, stop arguing about dumb stuff, look out for one another and realize that in the big scheme of things our time on earth is a very short one...so make it the most productive and positive time you can.
Please continue to keep us in our thoughts and prayers and understand that officers have accepted the call to run toward chaos...when the common sense thing to do is to run away from it.
Thank you for all of your continued support for our local law enforcement officers, it does not go unnoticed!
Chief Sawyer
